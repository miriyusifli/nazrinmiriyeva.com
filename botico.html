                platform to help traders and investors achieve smarter, faster, and more consistent trading results

                    As Botico had no previous online presence, the primary objective of this project was to design a
                    comprehensive and visually engaging website from scratch. The website needed to communicate Botico’s
                    mission clearly, showcase its innovative features, and provide a seamless user experience for
                    prospective clients. My goal was to create a platform that effectively reflects the brand's identity
                    while simplifying complex trading concepts for users of various experience levels.

                <p class="text-lg leading-normal">With no existing website to reference, Botico faced a challenge in
                    establishing a strong online presence. The lack of a platform meant potential users had no
                    centralized point of engagement to learn about the brand, explore its features, or understand its
                    value proposition.</p>

                <h5 class="text-2xl mt-0 mb-2 font-semibold">Solution</h5>
                <p class="text-lg leading-normal">To address this gap, I designed and developed a comprehensive website
                    for Botico from the ground up. The site was crafted to clearly communicate the platform’s mission,
                    features, and value to potential users. It serves as a central hub where users can explore Botico’s
                    offerings, understand its benefits, and build trust through a professional and user-friendly
                    interface. The design emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and brand consistency to support both user
                    engagement and business growth.</p>

                    features that could set Botico apart. The insights gained were directly applied to crafting the
                    website’s information architecture, wireframes, and high-fidelity designs. I led the end-to-end
                    design process, preparing detailed handoff files for development and ensuring smooth collaboration.

                <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">To bring my paper sketches to life, I created digital wireframes
                    in Figma. At this stage, I kept things simple — no colors, images, or fancy visuals. The goal was to
                    focus purely on the structure and layout, making sure everything was in the right place.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    I mapped out key sections like navigation, product value highlights, and call-to-action buttons to
                    guide users seamlessly through the website. Staying in lo-fi allowed me to quickly test ideas and
                    make changes without getting caught up in the details too soon. This approach set a solid foundation
                    for the next steps in the design process.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-normal">Designing the Botico website from scratch was both an exciting
                    challenge and a valuable learning experience. Without an existing site to reference, I relied
                    heavily on competitive analysis to shape the structure and content, ensuring the design aligned with
                    industry standards while highlighting Botico's unique offerings.
                    One of the key challenges was translating complex trading features into a clear, engaging design.
                    This required thoughtful decisions around layout and content to prioritize user clarity while
                    communicating the platform's advanced capabilities.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    This project reinforced my ability to work independently, make strategic design choices, and adapt
                    without traditional user feedback. The next step involves applying these learnings to design
                    Botico’s full trading application, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience for traders
                    across platforms.</p>
