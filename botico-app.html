                    application from the ground up. My contributions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting competitive analysis to understand market gaps and opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating closely with the CEO and team to refine ideas and define product requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating UX flows, wireframes, and UI designs to establish an intuitive and efficient trading
                        experience.</li>
                    <li>Iterating on feedback to ensure a seamless user journey.</li>

                    <h6 class="text-xl mt-0 mb-2">Why build the Botico App?</h6>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">When we started working on Botico, we realized that traders
                        were struggling with scattered tools. They had to jump between different platforms to create
                        strategies, manage risks, and track their performance. The process was complicated,
                        time-consuming, and not optimized for efficiency.

                <div>
                    <h6 class="text-xl mt-0 mb-2">What was missing in the market?</h6>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">During my discussions with the CEO and team, we explored
                        what was lacking in existing platforms. A few key issues stood out:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Lack of customization</span> – Most platforms had rigid
                            workflows that didn’t allow traders to tailor strategies to their needs.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Too many disconnected tools</span> – Users had to rely on
                            multiple apps for different parts of their trading process.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Overly complex interfaces</span> – Many trading tools were
                            overwhelming, making it difficult for both beginners and experienced traders to
                            navigate.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Limited AI-driven insights</span> – There was a huge
                            opportunity to use AI for smarter decision-making and optimization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">We saw a clear gap in the market: traders needed an
                        all-in-one platform that was powerful yet easy to use, allowing them to automate their
                        strategies, manage risks, and make data-driven decisions—all in one place. That’s exactly
                        what we set out to build with Botico.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-normal">Before diving into the design, I needed to understand what was already
                    out there. I started by analyzing existing trading platforms to identify what they did well and
                    where they fell short.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">I explored several well-known trading platforms, looking at
                        their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s what I found.
                    <ul class="list-none">
                        <li> <i data-lucide="square-check" class="icon" style="color:green"></i> Strong automation
                            features – Some platforms had solid automation tools, but they were often complicated and
                            required coding knowledge.</li>
                        <li><i data-lucide="square-x" class="icon" style="color:red"></i> Rigid strategy building – Many
                            platforms forced traders to follow predefined workflows instead of letting them create
                            flexible, customized strategies.</li>
                        <li><i data-lucide="square-x" class="icon" style="color:red"></i> Confusing user experience –
                            Most interfaces were cluttered with too much data, making it overwhelming to navigate.</li>

                            While some platforms offered basic analytics, they didn’t leverage AI to help traders

                    I developed a design system that served as a foundation for the application’s visual language. This
                    included typography, color palettes, spacing, button styles, form elements, and other reusable UI
                    components. The system not only helped streamline the design process but also ensured a cohesive
                    experience across different screens and features.
                    </br>
                    While I’m not showcasing the full design system here, it played a crucial role in keeping the
