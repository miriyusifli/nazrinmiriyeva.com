                    application from the ground up. My contributions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting competitive analysis to understand market gaps and opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Collaborating closely with the CEO and team to refine ideas and define product requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating UX flows, wireframes, and UI designs to establish an intuitive and efficient trading
                        experience.</li>

                    <h6 class="text-xl mt-0 mb-2 font-semibold">Why build the Botico App?</h6>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">When we started working on Botico, we realized that traders
                        were struggling with scattered tools. They had to jump between different platforms to create
                        strategies, manage risks, and track their performance. The process was complicated,
                        time-consuming, and not optimized for efficiency.

                <div>
                    <h6 class="text-xl mt-0 mb-2 font-semibold">What was missing in the market?</h6>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">During my discussions with the CEO and team, we explored
                        what was lacking in existing platforms. A few key issues stood out:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Lack of customization</span> – Most platforms had rigid
                            workflows that didn’t allow traders to tailor strategies to their needs.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Too many disconnected tools</span> – Users had to rely on
                            multiple apps for different parts of their trading process.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Overly complex interfaces</span> – Many trading tools were
                            overwhelming, making it difficult for both beginners and experienced traders to
                            navigate.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Limited AI-driven insights</span> – There was a huge
                            opportunity to use AI for smarter decision-making and optimization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">We saw a clear gap in the market: traders needed an
                        all-in-one platform that was powerful yet easy to use, allowing them to automate their
                        strategies, manage risks, and make data-driven decisions—all in one place. That’s exactly
                        what we set out to build with Botico.</p>

                    out there. I started by analyzing existing trading platforms to identify what they did well and

                    <p class="text-lg leading-normal mb-4">I explored several well-known trading platforms, looking at
                        their strengths and weaknesses. Here’s what I found:

                            required coding knowledge.</li>

                            flexible, customized strategies.</li>
                        <li><i data-lucide="square-x" class="md-icon" style="color:red;"></i> Confusing user

                    I developed a design system that served as a foundation for the application’s visual language. This

                    components. The system not only helped streamline the design process but also ensured a cohesive
                    experience across different screens and features.
                    </br>
                    While I’m not showcasing the full design system here, it played a crucial role in keeping the

                                <span class="font-semibold">Dashboard</span> – As the entry point to the Botico app, the
                                dashboard is designed to offer users immediate clarity and confidence in their trading
                                activities. My goal was to surface key performance and market insights in a way that's
                                both visually digestible and action-oriented.
                                <br>
                                By organizing the content into modular cards, users can quickly grasp essential
                                information—like their balance trend, bot performance, and overall market
                                sentiment—without feeling overwhelmed. Strategic use of visual indicators, such as the
                                Fear & Greed index and performance graphs, supports faster decision-making while
                                maintaining a clean, intuitive layout.
                                <br>
                                This approach ensures the dashboard functions not just as a status report, but as a
                                smart, empowering launchpad for users navigating dynamic trading environments.

                            With no existing product in place, I had full ownership of shaping the structure, user
                            flows, and visual identity. This gave me the freedom—and challenge—of building a product
                            experience from the ground up.

                            Working closely with the CEO and development team helped me refine ideas quickly. Regular
                            feedback loops were essential to aligning business goals with user needs and technical
                            constraints.

                            A key focus was turning advanced trading features into something intuitive. I learned how to
                            translate technical tools like algorithmic strategies and backtesting into a clear,
                            approachable UI.

                            This project boosted my confidence in owning end-to-end design. From UX thinking to UI
                            execution, I became more comfortable making product decisions and advocating for user-first
                            solutions.

                <p class="text-lg leading-normal">Since the launch of the beta version of Botico, the application has
                    already started to make a significant impact on users and the trading process. Although still in
                    development, the platform is continuously evolving, with ongoing improvements guided by user
                    feedback and internal collaboration. The team, including myself, is actively working to enhance the
                    platform's performance, usability, and overall user experience.
                    </br></br>
                    Even at this early stage, Botico has received positive responses from its initial users, helping
                    traders streamline their workflows and automate trading strategies. The intuitive design, combined
                    with AI-powered optimization tools, has already begun to improve trading efficiency and reduce risks
                    for users.
                    </br></br>
                    As the platform progresses beyond the beta phase, the impact will continue to grow, as we continue
                    refining features and adding new functionalities that will make Botico an even more powerful tool
                    for algorithmic traders..</p>
